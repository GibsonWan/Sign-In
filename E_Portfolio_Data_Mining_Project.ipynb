Other than that, businesses also practice **preventive maintenance**, where they determine the useful lifespan for a parts, and maintain or replace it before a failure. But, both of this still have high costs of scheduled and business downtime. So, with **Predicitive maintenance** technique, it designed to help determine the condition of in-service equipment in oder to estimate when the maintenance should be performend. It balanced between corrective maintenance and preventive maintenance.\r\n"
